# My-SQL Portfolio-
Welcome to my SQL portfolio. 

On my Excel project I cleaned the data, created pivot tables and dashboads based on my pivot tables information. I created different sheets where I did all my work. 

I created dashboards on the average income of Males and females who did and didn't purchase a bike. Second dashboard is based on the commute distance that did or did not purchase bikes. Third dasdboard is age bracket of who did or didn't purchase a bike.
